# Clothing-Store / Luxe Threads Website

Welcome to the Luxe Threads Website repository! This project represents the front-end development of the Luxe Threads fashion brand's online presence.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **react-icons**: Collection of popular icons for React applications.
- **react-scroll-parallax**: React component for parallax scrolling effects.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating a visually appealing and modern web interface for the Luxe Threads brand. It is currently a front-end-only project, with plans to implement backend functionality in the future.

### Features
